                   Jaalee Beacon iOS SDK allows for:

                   * beacon ranging (scan beacons and optionally filters them by their values)
                   * beacon monitoring (monitors regions for those devices that have entered/exited a region)
                   * beacon characteristic reading and writing (proximity UUID, major & minor values, broadcasting power, advertising interval), see BeaconConnection class and demos in the source code
